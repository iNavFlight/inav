### yaw_rate

Defines rotation rate on YAW axis that UAV will try to archive on max. stick deflection. Rates are defined in tens of degrees (deca-degrees) per second [rate = dps/10]. That means, rate 20 represents 200dps rotation speed. Default 20 (200dps) is more less equivalent of old Cleanflight/Baseflight rate 0. Max. 180 (1800dps) is what gyro can measure.
