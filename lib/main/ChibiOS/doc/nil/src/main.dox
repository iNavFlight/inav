/**
 * @mainpage Introduction
 * @author Giovanni Di Sirio (gdisirio@users.sourceforge.net).
 *
 * <h2>Why Nil?</h2>
 * Of course because it is so small that it is almost nil.
 * I wrote Nil because I wanted to experiment with an idea I had
 * regarding a minimal RTOS. Basically I wanted to verify how small
 * could be an RTOS while retaining useful features.
 *
 * <h2>Features</h2>
 * - Free software, GPL3 licensed. Stable releases include a exception clause
 *   to the GPL.
 * - Designed for realtime applications.
 * - Easily portable.
 * - Preemptive scheduling.
 * - Each thread has its own priority level.
 * - Offers tasks, time, semaphores, event flags, timeouts.
 * - Fully static.
 * - Minimal system requirements: about 700 bytes ROM with all options enabled.
 * - Almost totally written in C with little ASM code required for ports.
 * - Compatible with ChibiOS/HAL.
 * - API compatible with ChibiOS/RT of which, ChibiOS/NIL, is functionally
 *   a subset.
 * .
