 * @mainpage Introduction
 * @author Giovanni Di Sirio (gdisirio@users.sourceforge.net).
 *
 * <h2>Features</h2>
 * - Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) supporting numerous high level device
 *   drivers abstracting common features in modern MCUs.
 * - Driver models for: ADC, CAN, DAC, EXT, GPT, I2C, I2S, ICU, MAC, MMC, PAL,
 *   PWM, RTC, SDC, Serial, UART, USB, USB-CDC, SPI, ST, WDG.
 * - Abstraction of streams.
 * - Abstraction of block devices.
 * - The drivers can be ported to virtually any MCU architecture thanks to
 *   an high level API.
 * - The HAL can be used with or without an RTOS.
 * - The HAL can be adapted to any reasonable RTOS thanks to an Operating
 *   System Abstraction Layer (OSAL). ChibiOS/RT and ChibiOS/NIL are supported
 *   out of the box.
