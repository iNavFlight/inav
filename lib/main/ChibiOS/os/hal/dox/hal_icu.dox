 * @defgroup ICU ICU Driver
 * @brief   Generic ICU Driver.
 * @details This module implements a generic ICU (Input Capture Unit) driver.
 *          The purpose of the driver is to measure period and duty cycle of
 *          an input digital signal (PWM input).
 * @pre     In order to use the ICU driver the @p HAL_USE_ICU option
 *          must be enabled in @p halconf.h.
 *
 * @section icu_1 Driver State Machine
 * The driver implements a state machine internally, not all the driver
 * functionalities can be used in any moment, any transition not explicitly
 * shown in the following diagram has to be considered an error and shall
 * be captured by an assertion (if enabled).

 *
 * @section icu_2 ICU Operations.
 * This driver abstracts a generic Input Capture Unit composed of:
 * - A clock prescaler.
 * - A main up counter.
 * - Two capture registers triggered by the rising and falling edges on
 *   the sampled input.
 * .
 * The ICU unit can be programmed to synchronize on the rising or falling
 * edge of the sample input:
 * - <b>ICU_INPUT_ACTIVE_HIGH</b>, a rising edge is the start signal.
 * - <b>ICU_INPUT_ACTIVE_LOW</b>, a falling edge is the start signal.
 * .
 * Callbacks are optionally invoked when:
 * - On the PWM de-activation edge.
 * - On the PWM activation edge, measurements for the previous cycle are
 *   available from this callback and can be retrieved using
 *   @p icuGetPeriodX() and @p icuGetWidthX().
 * .
