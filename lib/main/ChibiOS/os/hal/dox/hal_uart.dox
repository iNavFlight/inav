 * @defgroup UART UART Driver
 * @brief   Generic UART Driver.
 * @details This driver abstracts a generic UART (Universal Asynchronous
 *          Receiver Transmitter) peripheral, the API is designed to be:
 *          - Unbuffered and copy-less, transfers are always directly performed
 *            from/to the application-level buffers without extra copy
 *            operations.
 *          - Asynchronous, the API is always non blocking.
 *          - Callbacks capable, operations completion and other events are
 *            notified using callbacks.
 *          .
 *          Special hardware features like deep hardware buffers, DMA transfers
 *          are hidden to the user but fully supportable by the low level
 *          implementations.<br>
 *          This driver model is best used where communication events are
 *          meant to drive an higher level state machine, as example:
 *          - RS485 drivers.
 *          - Multipoint network drivers.
 *          - Serial protocol decoders.
 *          .
 *          If your application requires a synchronous buffered driver then
 *          the @ref SERIAL should be used instead.
 * @pre     In order to use the UART driver the @p HAL_USE_UART option
 *          must be enabled in @p halconf.h.
 *
 * @section uart_1 Driver State Machine
 * The driver implements a state machine internally, not all the driver
 * functionalities can be used in any moment, any transition not explicitly
 * shown in the following diagram has to be considered an error and shall
 * be captured by an assertion (if enabled).

 * @subsection uart_1_1 Transmitter sub State Machine
 * The follow diagram describes the transmitter state machine, this diagram
 * is valid while the driver is in the @p UART_READY state. This state
 * machine is automatically reset to the @p TX_IDLE state each time the
 * driver enters the @p UART_READY state.

 * The follow diagram describes the receiver state machine, this diagram
