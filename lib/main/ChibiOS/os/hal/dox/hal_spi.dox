 * @defgroup SPI SPI Driver
 * @brief   Generic SPI Driver.
 * @details This module implements a generic SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)
 *          driver allowing bidirectional and monodirectional transfers,
 *          complex atomic transactions are supported as well.
 * @pre     In order to use the SPI driver the @p HAL_USE_SPI option
 *          must be enabled in @p halconf.h.
 *
 * @section spi_1 Driver State Machine
 * The driver implements a state machine internally, not all the driver
 * functionalities can be used in any moment, any transition not explicitly
 * shown in the following diagram has to be considered an error and shall
 * be captured by an assertion (if enabled).

 * the SPI bus from multiple threads then use the @p spiAcquireBus() and
 * @p spiReleaseBus() APIs in order to gain exclusive access.
