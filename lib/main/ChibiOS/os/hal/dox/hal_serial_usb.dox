 * @defgroup SERIAL_USB Serial over USB Driver
 * @brief   Serial over USB Driver.
 * @details This module implements an USB Communication Device Class
 *          (CDC) as a normal serial communication port accessible from
 *          the device application.
 * @pre     In order to use the USB over Serial driver the
 *          @p HAL_USE_SERIAL_USB option must be enabled in @p halconf.h.
 *
 * @section usb_serial_1 Driver State Machine
 * The driver implements a state machine internally, not all the driver
 * functionalities can be used in any moment, any transition not explicitly
 * shown in the following diagram has to be considered an error and shall
 * be captured by an assertion (if enabled).
