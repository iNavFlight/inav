 * @defgroup USB USB Driver
 * @brief   Generic USB Driver.
 * @details This module implements a generic USB (Universal Serial Bus) driver
 *          supporting device-mode operations.
 * @pre     In order to use the USB driver the @p HAL_USE_USB option
 *          must be enabled in @p halconf.h.
 *
 * @section usb_1 Driver State Machine
 * The driver implements a state machine internally, not all the driver
 * functionalities can be used in any moment, any transition not explicitly
 * shown in the following diagram has to be considered an error and shall
 * be captured by an assertion (if enabled).

 * @section usb_2 USB Operations
 * The USB driver is quite complex and USB is complex in itself, it is
 * recommended to study the USB specification before trying to use the
 * driver.
 *
 * @subsection usb_2_1 USB Implementation
 * The USB driver abstracts the inner details of the underlying USB hardware.
 * The driver works asynchronously and communicates with the application
 * using callbacks. The application is responsible of the descriptors and
 * strings required by the USB device class to be implemented and of the
 * handling of the specific messages sent over the endpoint zero. Standard
 * messages are handled internally to the driver. The application can use
 * hooks in order to handle custom messages or override the handling of the
 * default handling of standard messages.
 *
 * @subsection usb_2_2 USB Endpoints
 * USB endpoints are the objects that the application uses to exchange
 * data with the host. There are two kind of endpoints:
 * - <b>IN</b> endpoints are used by the application to transmit data to
 *   the host.<br>
 * - <b>OUT</b> endpoints are used by the application to receive data from
 *   the host.
 * .
 * The driver invokes a callback after finishing an IN or OUT transaction.
 * States diagram for OUT endpoints in transaction mode:

 *
 * @subsection usb_2_4 USB Callbacks
 * The USB driver uses callbacks in order to interact with the application.
 * There are several kinds of callbacks to be handled:
 * - Driver events callback. As example errors, suspend event, reset event
 *   etc.
 * - Messages Hook callback. This hook allows the application to implement
 *   handling of custom messages or to override the default handling of
 *   standard messages on endpoint zero.
 * - Descriptor Requested callback. When the driver endpoint zero handler
 *   receives a GET DESCRIPTOR message and needs to send a descriptor to
 *   the host it queries the application using this callback.
 * - Start of Frame callback. This callback is invoked each time a SOF
 *   packet is received.
 * - Endpoint callbacks. Each endpoint informs the application about I/O
 *   conditions using those callbacks.
