 * @defgroup I2C I2C Driver
 * @brief   Generic I2C Driver.
 * @details This module implements a generic I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)
 *          driver.
 * @pre     In order to use the I2C driver the @p HAL_USE_I2C option
 *          must be enabled in @p halconf.h.
 *
 * @section i2c_1 Driver State Machine
 * The driver implements a state machine internally, not all the driver
 * functionalities can be used in any moment, any transition not explicitly
 * shown in the following diagram has to be considered an error and shall
 * be captured by an assertion (if enabled).
