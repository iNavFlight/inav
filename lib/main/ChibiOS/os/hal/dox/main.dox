 * @defgroup IO HAL
 * @brief   Hardware Abstraction Layer.
 * @details Under ChibiOS the set of the various device driver interfaces
 * is called the HAL subsystem: Hardware Abstraction Layer. The HAL is the
 * abstract interface between ChibiOS applications and hardware.
 *
 * @section hal_device_driver_arch HAL Device Drivers Architecture
 * The HAL contains several kind of modules:
 * - Normal Device Drivers
 * - Complex Device Drivers
 * - Interfaces
 * - Inner Code
 * .
 * @section hal_normal_device_drivers HAL Normal Device Drivers
 * Normal device are meant to interface the application to the underlying
 * hardware through an high level API. Normal Device Drivers are split in two
 * layers:
 * - High Level Device Driver (<b>HLD</b>). This layer contains the definitions
 *   of the driver's APIs and the platform independent part of the driver.<br>
 *   An HLD is composed by two files:
 *   - @p hal_@<driver@>.c, the HLD implementation file. This file must be
 *     included in the Makefile in order to use the driver.
 *   - @p hal_@<driver@>.h, the HLD header file. This file is implicitly
 *     included by the HAL header file @p hal.h.
 *   .
 * - Low Level Device Driver (<b>LLD</b>). This layer contains the platform
 *   dependent part of the driver.<br>
 *   A LLD is composed by two files:
 *   - @p hal_@<driver@>_lld.c, the LLD implementation file. This file must be
 *     included in the Makefile in order to use the driver.
 *   - @p hal_@<driver@>_lld.h, the LLD header file. This file is implicitly
 *     included by the HLD header file.

 *
 * @section hal_complex_device_drivers HAL Complex Device Drivers
 * It is a class of device drivers that offer an high level API but do not
 * use the hardware directly. Complex device drivers use other drivers for
 * accessing the machine resources.
 *
 * @section hal_interfaces HAL Interfaces
 * An interface is a binary structure allowing the access to a service
 * using virtual functions. This allows to create drivers that can be
 * accessed using a common interface.
 * The concept of interface is commonly found in object-oriented languages
 * like Java or C++, their meaning in ChibiOS/HAL is exactly the same.
 *
 * @section hal_inner_code HAL Inner Code
 * Some modules are shared among multiple device drivers and are not
 * necessarily meant to be used by the application layer.

 * @defgroup OSAL OSAL
 * @brief   Operating System Abstraction Layer.
 * @details <h2>The OSAL</h2>
 *          The OSAL is the link between ChibiOS/HAL and services
 *          provided by operating systems like:
 *          - Critical Zones handling.
 *          - Interrupts handling.
 *          - Runtime Errors management.
 *          - Inter-task synchronization.
 *          - Task-ISR synchronization.
 *          - Time management.
 *          - Events.
 *          .
 *          ChibiOS/HAL is designed to tightly integrate with the underlying
 *          RTOS in order to provide the best experience to developers and
 *          minimize integration issues.<br>
 *          This section describes the API that OSALs are expected to expose
 *          to the HAL.
 *
 *          <h2>RTOS Requirements</h2>
 *          The OSAL API closely resembles the ChibiOS/RT API, for obvious
 *          reasons, however an OSAL module can be implemented for any
 *          reasonably complete RTOS or even a RTOS-less bare metal
 *          machine, if required.<br>
 *          In order to be able to support an HAL an RTOS should support the
 *          following minimal set of features:
 *          - Task-level critical zones API.
 *          - ISR-level critical zones API, only required on those CPU
 *            architectures supporting preemptable ISRs like Cortex-Mx
 *            cores.
 *          - Ability to invoke API functions from inside a task critical
 *            zone. Functions that are required to support this feature are
 *            marked with an "I" or "S" letter at the end of the name.
 *          - Ability to invoke API functions from inside an ISR critical
 *            zone. Functions that are required to support this feature are
 *            marked with an "I" letter at the end of the name.
 *          - Tasks Queues or Counting Semaphores with Timeout capability.
 *          - Ability to suspend a task and wakeup it from ISR with Timeout
 *            capability.
 *          - Event flags, the mechanism can be simulated using callbacks in
 *            case the RTOS does not support it.
 *          - Mutual Exclusion mechanism like Semaphores or Mutexes.
 *          .
 *          All the above requirements can be satisfied even on naked HW with
 *          a very think SW layer. In case that the HAL is required to work
 *          without an RTOS.
 *
 *          <h2>Supported RTOSes</h2>
 *          The RTOSes supported out of the box are:
 *          - ChibiOS/RT
 *          - ChibiOS/NIL
 *          .
 *          Implementations have also been successfully created on RTOSes not
 *          belonging to the ChibiOS products family but are not supported
 *          as a core feature of ChibiOS/HAL.
