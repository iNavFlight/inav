 * @defgroup PWM PWM Driver
 * @brief   Generic PWM Driver.
 * @details This module implements a generic PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)
 *          driver.
 * @pre     In order to use the PWM driver the @p HAL_USE_PWM option
 *          must be enabled in @p halconf.h.
 *
 * @section pwm_1 Driver State Machine
 * The driver implements a state machine internally, not all the driver
 * functionalities can be used in any moment, any transition not explicitly
 * shown in the following diagram has to be considered an error and shall
 * be captured by an assertion (if enabled).

 *
 * @section pwm_2 PWM Operations.
 * This driver abstracts a generic PWM timer composed of:
 * - A clock prescaler.
 * - A main up counter.
 * - A comparator register that resets the main counter to zero when the limit
 *   is reached. An optional callback can be generated when this happens.
 * - An array of @p PWM_CHANNELS PWM channels, each channel has an output,
 *   a comparator and is able to invoke an optional callback when a comparator
 *   match with the main counter happens.
 * .
 * A PWM channel output can be in two different states:
 * - <b>IDLE</b>, when the channel is disabled or after a match occurred.
 * - <b>ACTIVE</b>, when the channel is enabled and a match didn't occur yet
 *   in the current PWM cycle.
 * .
 * Note that the two states can be associated to both logical zero or one in
 * the @p PWMChannelConfig structure.
