/**
 * @defgroup SERIAL Serial Driver
 * @brief   Generic Serial Driver.
 * @details This module implements a generic full duplex serial driver. The
 *          driver implements a @p SerialDriver interface and uses I/O Queues
 *          for communication between the upper and the lower driver. Event
 *          flags are used to notify the application about incoming data,
 *          outgoing data and other I/O events.<br>
 *          The  module also contains functions that make the implementation
 *          of the interrupt service routines much easier.
 * @pre     In order to use the SERIAL driver the @p HAL_USE_SERIAL option
 *          must be enabled in @p halconf.h.
 *
 *
 * @section serial_1 Driver State Machine
 * The driver implements a state machine internally, not all the driver
 * functionalities can be used in any moment, any transition not explicitly
 * shown in the following diagram has to be considered an error and shall
 * be captured by an assertion (if enabled).
