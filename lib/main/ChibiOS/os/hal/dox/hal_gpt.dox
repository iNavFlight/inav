 * @defgroup GPT GPT Driver
 * @brief   Generic GPT Driver.
 * @details This module implements a generic GPT (General Purpose Timer)
 *          driver. The timer can be programmed in order to trigger callbacks
 *          after a specified time period or continuously with a specified
 *          interval.
 * @pre     In order to use the GPT driver the @p HAL_USE_GPT option
 *          must be enabled in @p halconf.h.
 *
 * @section gpt_1 Driver State Machine
 * The driver implements a state machine internally, not all the driver
 * functionalities can be used in any moment, any transition not explicitly
 * shown in the following diagram has to be considered an error and shall
 * be captured by an assertion (if enabled).

 *
 * @section gpt_2 GPT Operations.
 * This driver abstracts a generic timer composed of:
 * - A clock prescaler.
 * - A main up counter.
 * - A comparator register that resets the main counter to zero when the limit
 *   is reached. A callback is invoked when this happens.
 * .
 * The timer can operate in three different modes:
 * - <b>Continuous Mode</b>, a periodic callback is invoked until the driver
 *   is explicitly stopped.
 * - <b>One Shot Mode</b>, a callback is invoked after the programmed period
 *   and then the timer automatically stops.
 * - <b>Delay Mode</b>, the timer is used for inserting a brief delay into
 *   the execution flow, no callback is invoked in this mode.
 * .
