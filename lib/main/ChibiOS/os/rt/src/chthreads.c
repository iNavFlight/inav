 * @brief   Threads code.
 *
 * @addtogroup threads
 * @details Threads related APIs and services.
 *          <h2>Operation mode</h2>
 *          A thread is an abstraction of an independent instructions flow.
 *          In ChibiOS/RT a thread is represented by a "C" function owning
 *          a processor context, state informations and a dedicated stack
 *          area. In this scenario static variables are shared among all
 *          threads while automatic variables are local to the thread.<br>
 *          Operations defined for threads:
 *          - <b>Create</b>, a thread is started on the specified thread
 *            function. This operation is available in multiple variants,
 *            both static and dynamic.
 *          - <b>Exit</b>, a thread terminates by returning from its top
 *            level function or invoking a specific API, the thread can
 *            return a value that can be retrieved by other threads.
 *          - <b>Wait</b>, a thread waits for the termination of another
 *            thread and retrieves its return value.
 *          - <b>Resume</b>, a thread created in suspended state is started.
 *          - <b>Sleep</b>, the execution of a thread is suspended for the
 *            specified amount of time or the specified future absolute time
 *            is reached.
 *          - <b>SetPriority</b>, a thread changes its own priority level.
 *          - <b>Yield</b>, a thread voluntarily renounces to its time slot.
 *          .
