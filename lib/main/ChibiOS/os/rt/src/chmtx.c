 * @file    chmtx.c
 * @brief   Mutexes code.
 *
 * @addtogroup mutexes
 * @details Mutexes related APIs and services.
 *          <h2>Operation mode</h2>
 *          A mutex is a threads synchronization object that can be in two
 *          distinct states:
 *          - Not owned (unlocked).
 *          - Owned by a thread (locked).
 *          .
 *          Operations defined for mutexes:
 *          - <b>Lock</b>: The mutex is checked, if the mutex is not owned by
 *            some other thread then it is associated to the locking thread
 *            else the thread is queued on the mutex in a list ordered by
 *            priority.
 *          - <b>Unlock</b>: The mutex is released by the owner and the highest
 *            priority thread waiting in the queue, if any, is resumed and made
 *            owner of the mutex.
 *          .
 *          <h2>Constraints</h2>
 *          In ChibiOS/RT the Unlock operations must always be performed
 *          in lock-reverse order. This restriction both improves the
 *          performance and is required for an efficient implementation
 *          of the priority inheritance mechanism.<br>
 *          Operating under this restriction also ensures that deadlocks
 *          are no possible.
 *
 *          <h2>Recursive mode</h2>
 *          By default mutexes are not recursive, this mean that it is not
 *          possible to take a mutex already owned by the same thread.
 *          It is possible to enable the recursive behavior by enabling the
 *          option @p CH_CFG_USE_MUTEXES_RECURSIVE.
 *
 *          <h2>The priority inversion problem</h2>
 *          The mutexes in ChibiOS/RT implements the <b>full</b> priority
 *          inheritance mechanism in order handle the priority inversion
 *          problem.<br>
 *          When a thread is queued on a mutex, any thread, directly or
 *          indirectly, holding the mutex gains the same priority of the
 *          waiting thread (if their priority was not already equal or higher).
 *          The mechanism works with any number of nested mutexes and any
 *          number of involved threads. The algorithm complexity (worst case)
 *          is N with N equal to the number of nested mutexes.
 * @pre     In order to use the mutex APIs the @p CH_CFG_USE_MUTEXES option
 *          must be enabled in @p chconf.h.
 * @post    Enabling mutexes requires 5-12 (depending on the architecture)
 *          extra bytes in the @p thread_t structure.
