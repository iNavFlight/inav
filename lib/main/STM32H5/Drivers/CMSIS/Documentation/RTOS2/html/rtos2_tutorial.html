<div class="textblock"><p>This tutorial is an introduction to using a small footprint real-time operating system on an Arm Cortex-M microcontroller. If you are used to writing procedural-based 'C' code on small 8-/16-bit microcontrollers, you may be doubtful about the need for such an operating system. If you are not familiar with using an RTOS in real-time embedded systems, you should read this chapter before dismissing the idea. The use of an RTOS represents a more sophisticated design approach, inherently fostering structured code development which is enforced by the RTOS application programming interface (API).</p>
<p>The RTOS structure allows you to take a more object-orientated design approach, while still programming in 'C'. The RTOS also provides you with multithreaded support on a small microcontroller. These two features actually create quite a shift in design philosophy, moving us away from thinking about procedural ‘C’ code and flow charts. Instead we consider the fundamental program threads and the flow of data between them. The use of an RTOS also has several additional benefits which may not be immediately obvious. Since an RTOS based project is composed of well-defined threads, it helps to improve project management, code reuse, and software testing.</p>
<p>The tradeoff for this is that an RTOS has additional memory requirements and increased interrupt latency. Typically, the Keil RTX5 RTOS will require 500 bytes of RAM and 5k bytes of code, but remember that some of the RTOS code would be replicated in your program anyway. We now have a generation of small low-cost microcontrollers that have enough on-chip memory and processing power to support the use of an RTOS. Developing using this approach is therefore much more accessible.</p>
<p>We will first look at setting up an introductory RTOS project for a Cortex-M based microcontroller. Next, we will go through each of the RTOS primitives and how they influence the design of our application code. Finally, when we have a clear understanding of the RTOS features, we will take a closer look at the RTOS configuration options. If you are used to programming a microcontroller without using an RTOS i.e. bare metal, there are two key things to understand as you work through this tutorial. In the first section, we will focus on creating and managing Threads. The key concept here is to consider them running as parallel concurrent objects. In the second section, we will look at how to communicate between threads. In this section the key concept is synchronization of the concurrent threads.</p>

First Steps with Keil RTX5</h1>
<p>The RTOS itself consists of a scheduler which supports round-robin, pre-emptive and co-operative multitasking of program threads, as well as time and memory management services. Inter-thread communication is supported by additional RTOS objects, including signal thread and event flags, semaphores, mutex, message passing and a memory pool system. As we will see, interrupt handling can also be accomplished by prioritized threads which are scheduled by the RTOS kernel.</p>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="rtos2_tutorial_access"></a>
Accessing the CMSIS-RTOS2 API</h1>
<p>To access any of the CMSIS-RTOS2 features in our application code, it is necessary to include the following header file. </p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="preprocessor">#include &lt;<a class="code" href="cmsis__os2_8h.html">cmsis_os2.h</a>&gt;</span></div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> This header file is maintained by Arm as part of the CMSIS-RTOS2 standard. For Keil RTX5, this is the default API. Other RTOS will have their own proprietary API but may provide a wrapper layer to implement the CMSIS-RTOS2 API so they can be used where compatibility with the CMSIS standard is required.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="rtos2_tutorial_threads"></a>
Threads</h1>
<p>The building blocks of a typical 'C' program are functions which we call to perform a specific procedure and which then return to the calling function. In CMSIS-RTOS2, the basic unit of execution is a "Thread". A Thread is very similar to a 'C' procedure but has some very fundamental differences. </p>

<div class="line">}</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> While we always return from our 'C' function, once started an RTOS thread must contain a loop so that it never terminates and thus runs forever. You can think of a thread as a mini self-contained program that runs within the RTOS. With the Arm Compiler, it is possible to optimize a thread by using a <code>__NO_RETURN</code> macro. This attribute reduces the cost of calling a function that never returns.</p>
<p>An RTOS program is made up of a number of threads, which are controlled by the RTOS scheduler. This scheduler uses the SysTick timer to generate a periodic interrupt as a time base. The scheduler will allot a certain amount of execution time to each thread. So <code>thread1</code> will run for 5 ms then be de-scheduled to allow <code>thread2</code> to run for a similar period; <code>thread2</code> will give way to <code>thread3</code> and finally control passes back to <code>thread1</code>. By allocating these slices of runtime to each thread in a round-robin fashion, we get the appearance of all three threads running in parallel to each other.</p>
<p>Conceptually we can think of each thread as performing a specific functional unit of our program with all threads running simultaneously. This leads us to a more object-orientated design, where each functional block can be coded and tested in isolation and then integrated into a fully running program. This not only imposes a structure on the design of our final application but also aids debugging, as a particular bug can be easily isolated to a specific thread. It also aids code reuse in later projects. When a thread is created, it is also allocated its own thread ID. This is a variable which acts as a handle for each thread and is used when we want to manage the activity of the thread. </p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><a class="code" href="group__CMSIS__RTOS__ThreadMgmt.html#gaa6c32fe2a3e0a2e01f212d55b02e51c7">osThreadId_t</a> id1, id2, id3;</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> In order to make the thread-switching process happen, we have the code overhead of the RTOS and we have to dedicate a CPU hardware timer to provide the RTOS time reference. In addition, each time we switch running threads, we have to save the state of all the thread variables to a thread stack. Also, all the runtime information about a thread is stored in a thread control block, which is managed by the RTOS kernel. Thus the “context switch time”, that is, the time to save the current thread state and load up and start the next thread, is a crucial figure and will depend on both the RTOS kernel and the design of the underlying hardware.</p>
<p>The Thread Control Block contains information about the status of a thread. Part of this information is its run state. In a given system, only one thread can be running and all the others will be suspended but ready to run. The RTOS has various methods of inter-thread communication (signals, semaphores, messages). Here, a thread may be suspended to wait to be signaled by another thread or interrupt before it resumes its ready state, whereupon it can be placed into running state by the RTOS scheduler.</p>
<table class="doxtable">
<tr>
<th>State </th><th>Description  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td>Running </td><td>The currently running thread </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Ready </td><td>Threads ready to run </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Wait </td><td>Blocked threads waiting for an OS event </td></tr>
</table>
<p>At any given moment a single thread may be running. The remaining threads will be ready to run and will be scheduled by the kernel. Threads may also be waiting pending an OS event. When this occurs they will return to the ready state and be scheduled by the kernel.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="rtos2_tutorial_start"></a>
Starting the RTOS</h1>
<p>To build a simple RTOS, program we declare each thread as a standard 'C' function and also declare a thread ID variable for each function. </p>

</div><!-- fragment --><p> Once the processor leaves the reset vector, we will enter the <code>main()</code> function as normal. Once in <code>main()</code>, we must call <a class="el" href="group__CMSIS__RTOS__KernelCtrl.html#gae818f6611d25ba3140bede410a52d659">osKernelInitialize()</a> to setup the RTOS. It is not possible to call any RTOS function before the <a class="el" href="group__CMSIS__RTOS__KernelCtrl.html#gae818f6611d25ba3140bede410a52d659">osKernelInitialize()</a> function has successfully completed. Once <a class="el" href="group__CMSIS__RTOS__KernelCtrl.html#gae818f6611d25ba3140bede410a52d659">osKernelInitialize()</a> has completed, we can create further threads and other RTOS objects. This can be done by creating a launcher thread, in the example below this is called <code>app_main()</code>. Inside the <code>app_main()</code> thread, we create all the RTOS threads and objects we need to start our application running. As we will see later, it is also possible to dynamically create and destroy RTOS objects as the application is running. Next, we can call <a class="el" href="group__CMSIS__RTOS__KernelCtrl.html#ga9ae2cc00f0d89d7b6a307bba942b5221">osKernelStart()</a> to start the RTOS and the scheduler task switching.

</div><!-- fragment --><p> When threads are created they are also assigned a priority. If there are a number of threads ready to run and they all have the same priority, they will be allotted run time in a round-robin fashion. However, if a thread with a higher priority becomes ready to run, the RTOS scheduler will de-schedule the currently running thread and start the high priority thread running. This is called pre-emptive priority-based scheduling. When assigning priorities, you have to be careful because the high priority thread will continue to run until it enters a waiting state or until a thread of equal or higher priority is ready to run.</p>

<p>Once the RTOS is running, there are a number of system calls that are used to manage and control the active threads. The documentation lists <a class="el" href="group__CMSIS__RTOS__ThreadMgmt.html">all thread management functions</a>.</p>
<p>As we saw in the first example, the <code>app_main()</code> thread is used as a launcher thread to create the application threads. This is done in two stages. First a thread structure is defined; this allows us to define the thread operating parameters. </p>

This is quite a lot of detail to go through but we will cover everything by the end of this application note. Once the thread structure has been defined, the thread can be created using the <a class="el" href="group__CMSIS__RTOS__ThreadMgmt.html#ga48d68b8666d99d28fa646ee1d2182b8f">osThreadNew()</a> API call.

<h1><a class="anchor" id="rtos2_tutorial_thread_mgmt"></a>
Thread Management and Priority</h1>
<p>When a thread is created it is assigned a priority level. The RTOS scheduler uses a thread’s priority to decide which thread should be scheduled to run. If a number of threads are ready to run, the thread with the highest priority will be placed in the run state. If a high priority thread becomes ready to run it will preempt a running thread of lower priority. Importantly, a high priority thread running on the CPU will not stop running unless it blocks on an RTOS API call or is preempted by a higher priority thread. A thread's priority is defined in the thread structure and the following priority definitions are available. The default priority is <a class="el" href="cmsis__os2_8h.html#gad4e3e0971b41f2d17584a8c6837342eca45a2895ad30c79fb97de18cac7cc19f1">osPriorityNormal</a>.

Memory Management</h1>
<p>When each thread is created, it is assigned its own stack for storing data during the context switch. This should not be confused with the native Cortex-M processor stack; it is really a block of memory that is allocated to the thread. A default stack size is defined in the RTOS configuration file (we will see this later) and this amount of memory will be allocated to each thread unless we override it to allocate a custom size. The default stack size will be assigned to a thread if the stack size value in the thread definition structure is set to zero. If necessary a thread can be given additional memory resources by defining a bigger stack size in the thread structure. Keil RTX5 supports several memory models to assign this thread memory. The default model is a global memory pool. In this model each RTOS object that is created (threads, message queues, semaphores etc.) are allocated memory from a single block of memory.</p>
<p>If an object is destroyed the memory it has been assigned is returned to the memory pool. This has the advantage of memory reuse but also introduces the possible problem of memory fragmentation.</p>
<p>The size of the global memory pool is defined in the configuration file: </p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="preprocessor">#define OS_DYNAMIC_MEM_SIZE         4096</span></div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> And the default stack size for each thread is defined in the threads section: </p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="preprocessor">#define OS_STACK_SIZE               256</span></div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> It is also possible to define object specific memory pools for each different type of RTOS object. In this model you define the maximum number of a specific object type and its memory requirements. The RTOS then calculates and reserves the required memory usage.</p>
<p>The object specific model is again defined in the RTOS configuration file by enabling the "object specific memory" option provided in each section of the configuration file: </p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="preprocessor">#define OS_SEMAPHORE_OBJ_MEM        1</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="preprocessor">#define OS_SEMAPHORE_NUM            1</span></div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> In the case of simple object which requires a fixed memory allocation we just need to define the maximum number of a given object type. In the case of more complex objects such as threads we will need to define the required memory usage: </p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="preprocessor">#define OS_THREAD_OBJ_MEM           1</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="preprocessor"></span><span class="preprocessor">#define OS_THREAD_NUM               1</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="preprocessor"></span><span class="preprocessor">#define OS_THREAD_DEF_STACK_NUM     0</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="preprocessor">#define OS_THREAD_USER_STACK_SIZE   1024</span></div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> To use the object specific memory allocation model with threads we must provide details of the overall thread memory usage. Finally it is possible to statically allocate the thread stack memory. This is important for safety related systems where memory usage has to be rigorously defined.</p>

<p>One of the interesting possibilities of an RTOS is that you can create multiple running instances of the same base thread code. For example, you could write a thread to control a UART and then create two running instances of the same thread code. Here, each instance of the UART code could manage a different UART. Then we can create two instances of the thread assigned to different thread handles. A parameter is also passed to allow each instance to identify which UART it is responsible for. </p>

Joinable Threads</h1>
<p>A new feature in CMSIS-RTOS2 is the ability to create threads in a 'joinable' state. This allows a thead to be created and executed as a standard thread. In addition, a second thread can join it by calling <a class="el" href="group__CMSIS__RTOS__ThreadMgmt.html#ga3fca90fb0679afeb968aa8c3d5874487">osThreadJoin()</a>. This will cause the second thread to deschedule and remain in a waiting state until the thread which has been joined is terminated. This allows a temporary joinable thread to be created, which would acquire a block of memory from the global memory pool, this thread could perform some processing and then terminate, releasing the memory back to the memory pool. A joinable thread can be created by setting the joinable attribute bit in the thread attributes structure as shown below: </p>

<p>The most basic of these timing services is a simple timer delay function. This is an easy way of providing timing delays within your application.

<h1><a class="anchor" id="rtos2_tutorial_interthread_com"></a>
Inter-thread Communication</h1>
<p>So far, we have seen how application code can be defined as independent threads and how we can access the timing services provided by the RTOS. In a real application, we need to be able to communicate between threads in order to make an application useful. To this end, a typical RTOS supports several different communication objects which can be used to link the threads together to form a meaningful program. The CMSIS-RTOS2 API supports inter-thread communication with thread and event flags, semaphores, mutexes, mailboxes and message queues. In the first section, the key concept was concurrency. In this section, the key concept is synchronizing the activity of multiple threads.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="rtos2_tutorial_thread_flags"></a>
Thread Flags</h2>
<p>Keil RTX5 supports up to thirty two thread flags for each thread. These thread flags are stored in the thread control block. It is possible to halt the execution of a thread until a particular thread flag or group of thread flags are set by another thread in the system.</p>
<p>The <a class="el" href="group__CMSIS__RTOS__ThreadFlagsMgmt.html#gac11542ad6300b600f872fc96e340ec2b">osThreadFlagsWait()</a> system calls will suspend execution of the thread and place it into the wait_evnt state.

It is also possible to define a periodic timeout after which the waiting thread will move back to the ready state, so that it can resume execution when selected by the scheduler. A value of <a class="el" href="group__CMSIS__RTOS__Definitions.html#ga9eb9a7a797a42e4b55eb171ecc609ddb">osWaitForever</a> (0xFFFF) defines an infinite timeout period. </p>

<p>First, we need to create a set of event flags, this is a similar process to creating a thread. We define an event flag attribute structure. The attribute structure defines an ASCII name string, attribute bits, and memory detention. If we are using the static memory model. </p>

Semaphores</h2>
<p>Like thread flags, semaphores are a method of synchronizing activity between two or more threads. Put simply, a semaphore is a container that holds a number of tokens. As a thread executes, it will reach an RTOS call to acquire a semaphore token. If the semaphore contains one or more tokens, the thread will continue executing and the number of tokens in the semaphore will be decremented by one. If there are currently no tokens in the semaphore, the thread will be placed in a waiting state until a token becomes available. At any point in its execution, a thread may add a token to the semaphore causing its token count to increment by one.</p>
<p>The diagram above illustrates the use of a semaphore to synchronize two threads. First, the semaphore must be created and initialized with an initial token count. In this case the semaphore is initialized with a single token. Both threads will run and reach a point in their code where they will attempt to acquire a token from the semaphore. The first thread to reach this point will acquire the token from the semaphore and continue execution. The second thread will also attempt to acquire a token, but as the semaphore is empty it will halt execution and be placed into a waiting state until a semaphore token is available.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the executing thread can release a token back to the semaphore. When this happens, the waiting thread will acquire the token and leave the waiting state for the ready state. Once in the ready state the scheduler will place the thread into the run state so that thread execution can continue. While semaphores have a simple set of OS calls they can be one of the more difficult OS objects to fully understand. In this section, we will first look at how to add semaphores to an RTOS program and then go on to look at the most useful semaphore applications.</p>
<p>To use a semaphore in the CMSIS-RTOS you must first declare a semaphore attributes: </p>

</div><!-- fragment --><p> Then within a thread the semaphore container can be initialised with a number of tokens: </p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">sem1 = <a class="code" href="group__CMSIS__RTOS__SemaphoreMgmt.html#ga2a39806ace781a0008a4374ca701b14a">osSemaphoreNew</a>(maxTokenCount,initalTokencount,&amp;<a class="code" href="group__CMSIS__RTOS__SemaphoreMgmt.html#structosSemaphoreAttr__t">osSemaphoreAttr_t</a>);</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> It is important to understand that semaphore tokens may also be created and destroyed as threads run. So for example you can initialise a semaphore with zero tokens and then use one thread to create tokens into the semaphore while another thread removes them. This allows you to design threads as producer and consumer threads.</p>
<p>Once the semaphore is initialized, tokens may be acquired and sent to the semaphore in a similar fashion to event flags. The <a class="el" href="group__CMSIS__RTOS__SemaphoreMgmt.html#ga7e94c8b242a0c81f2cc79ec22895c87b">osSemaphoreAcquire()</a> call is used to block a thread until a semaphore token is available.

Using Semaphores</h3>
<p>Although semaphores have a simple set of OS calls, they have a wide range of synchronizing applications. This makes them perhaps the most challenging RTOS object to understand.

<div class="line">}</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> In this example we initialise the multiplex semaphore with five tokens. Before a thread can call the <code>processBuffer()</code> function, it must acquire a semaphore token. Once the function has completed, the token is sent back to the semaphore. If more than five threads are attempting to call <code>processBuffer()</code>, the sixth must wait until a thread has finished with <code>processBuffer()</code> and returns its token. Thus, the multiplex semaphore ensures that a maximum of five threads can call the <code>processBuffer()</code> function "simultaneously".</p>

</div><!-- fragment --><p> In this code, we use a global variable to count the number of threads which have arrived at the barrier. As each function arrives at the barrier it will wait until it can acquire a token from the counter semaphore. Once acquired, the count variable will be incremented by one. Once we have incremented the count variable, a token is sent to the counter semaphore so that other waiting threads can proceed. Next, the barrier code reads the count variable. If this is equal to the number of threads which are waiting to arrive at the barrier, we send a token to the barrier semaphore.</p>
<p>In the example above we are synchronising five threads. The first four threads will increment the count variable and then wait at the barrier semaphore. The fifth and last thread to arrive will increment the count variable and send a token to the barrier semaphore. This will allow it to immediately acquire a barrier semaphore token and continue execution. After passing through the barrier, it immediately sends another token to the barrier semaphore. This allows one of the other waiting threads to resume execution. This thread places another token in the barrier semaphore which triggers another waiting thread and so on. This final section of the barrier code is called a turnstile because it allows one thread at a time to pass the barrier. In our model of concurrent execution this means that each thread waits at the barrier until the last arrives then the all resume simultaneously. In the following exercise we create five instances of one thread containing barrier code. However, the barrier could be used to synchronise five unique threads.</p>

Semaphore Caveats</h3>
<p>Semaphores are an extremely useful feature of any RTOS. However semaphores can be misused. You must always remember that the number of tokens in a semaphore is not fixed. During the runtime of a program semaphore tokens may be created and destroyed. Sometimes this is useful, but if your code depends on having a fixed number of tokens available to a semaphore you must be very careful to always return tokens back to it. You should also rule out the possibility of accidently creating additional new tokens.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="rtos2_tutorial_mutex"></a>
Mutex</h2>
<p>Mutex stands for “Mutual Exclusion”. In reality, a mutex is a specialized version of semaphore. Like a semaphore, a mutex is a container for tokens. The difference is that a mutex can only contain one token which cannot be created or destroyed. The principle use of a mutex is to control access to a chip resource such as a peripheral. For this reason a mutex token is binary and bounded. Apart from this it really works in the same way as a semaphore. First of all we must declare the mutex container and initialize the mutex: </p>

Mutex Caveats</h3>
<p>Clearly, you must take care to return the mutex token when you are finished with the chip resource, or you will have effectively prevented any other thread from accessing it. You must also be extremely careful about using the <a class="el" href="group__CMSIS__RTOS__ThreadMgmt.html#ga2f8ba6dba6e9c065a6e236ffd410d74a">osThreadTerminate()</a> call on functions which control a mutex token. Keil RTX5 is designed to be a small footprint RTOS so that it can run on even the very small Cortex-M microcontrollers. Consequently, there is no thread deletion safety. This means that if you delete a thread which is controlling a mutex token, you will destroy the mutex token and prevent any further access to the guarded peripheral.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="rtos2_tutorial_data_exchange"></a>
Data Exchange</h2>
<p>So far, all of the inter-thread communication methods have only been used to trigger execution of threads; they do not upport the exchange of program data between threads. Clearly, in a real program we will need to move data between threads. This could be done by reading and writing to globally declared variables. In anything but a very simple program, trying to guarantee data integrity would be extremely difficult and prone to unforeseen errors. The exchange of data between threads needs a more formal asynchronous method of communication.</p>
<p>CMSIS-RTOS provides two methods of data transfer between threads. The first method is a message queue which creates a buffered data 'pipe' between two threads. The message queue is designed to transfer integer values.</p>
<p>The second form of data transfer is a mail queue. This is very similar to a message queue except that it transfers blocks of data rather than a single integer.</p>
<p>Message and mail queues both provide a method for transferring data between threads. This allows you to view your design as a collection of objects (threads) interconnected by data flows. The data flow is implemented by message and mail queues. This provides both a buffered transfer of data and a well defined communication interface between threads. Starting with a system level design based on threads connected by mail and message queues allows you to code different subsystems of your project, especially useful if you are working in a team. Also as each thread has well defined inputs and outputs it is easy to isolate for testing and code reuse.</p>

<p>We can design a message queue to support the transfer of large amounts of data. However, this method has an overhead in that we are "moving" the data in the queue. In this section, we will look at designing a more efficient "zero copy" mailbox where the data remains static. CMSIS-RTOS2 supports the dynamic allocation of memory in the form of a fixed block memory pool. First, we can declare the memory pool attributes: </p>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="rtos2_tutorial_config"></a>
Configuration</h1>
<p>So far we have looked at the CMSIS-RTOS2 API. This includes thread management functions, time management and inter-thread communication. Now that we have a clear idea of exactly what the RTOS kernel is capable of, we can take a more detailed look at the configuration file.</p>
<p>RTX_Config.h is the central configuration file for all of the Cortex-M based microcontrollers. Like the other configuration files, it is a template file which presents all the necessary configurations as a set of menu options (when viewed in Configuration Wizard view).</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="rtos2_tutorial_config_sys"></a>
System Configuration</h2>
<p>Before we discuss the settings in the system configuration section, it is worth mentioning what is missing. In earlier versions of CMSIS-RTOS, it was necessary to define the CPU frequency as part of the RTOS configuration. In CMSIS-RTOS2, the CPU frequency is now taken from the "SystemCoreClock" variable which is set as part of the CMSIS-Core system startup code. If you are working with a new microcontroller you will need to check that this value is being set correctly.</p>
<p>As we have seen earlier, we can set the amount of memory allocated to the "Global Dynamic Memory Pool". Next, we can define the tick frequency in Hertz. This defines the SysTick interrupt rate and is set to 1 ms by default. Generally, I would leave this frequency at its default setting. However, processor clock speeds are getting ever faster. If you are using a high performance device you may consider using a faster tick rate.</p>
<p>"Round Robin Thread" switching is also enabled by default in this section. Again, I would recommend leaving these settings in their default state unless you have a strong requirement to change them. The system configuration settings also allow us to control the range of messages sent to the event recorder as the RTOS runs.</p>
<p>Finally, if we are setting thread flags from an interrupt they are held in a queue until they are processed. Depending on your application you may need to increase the size of this queue.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="rtos2_tutorial_config_thread"></a>
Thread Configuration</h2>
<p>In the Thread Configuration section, we define the basic resources which will be required by the CMSIS-RTOS2 threads. For each thread we allocate a "default thread stack space" (by default, this is 200 bytes). As you create threads, this memory will be allocated from the Global Dynamic Mmemory Pool. However, if we enable Object specific memory allocation the RTOS will define a memory region which is dedicated to thread usage only. If you switch to object specific memory allocation, it is necessary to provide details about the number and size of threads memory so the RTOS can calculate the maximum memory requirement.</p>
<p>For object specific memory allocation, we must define the maximum number of user threads (don’t count the idle or timer threads) which will be running. We must also define the number of threads which have a default stack size and also the total amount of memory required by threads with custom tack sizes. Once we have defined the memory used by user threads, we can allocate memory to the idle thread. During development, CMSIS-RTOS can trap stack overflows. When this option is enabled, an overflow of a thread stack space will cause the RTOS kernel to call the <a class="el" href="group__rtx5__specific__functions.html#gaf1745a88f9cc60b609ab1c8076bd346d">osRtxErrorNotify()</a> function which is located in the RTX_Config.c file. This function gets an error code and then sits in an infinite loop. The stack checking option is intended for use during debugging and should be disabled on the final application to minimize the kernel overhead. However, it is possible to modify the <a class="el" href="group__rtx5__specific__functions.html#gaf1745a88f9cc60b609ab1c8076bd346d">osRtxErrorNotify()</a> function if enhanced error protection is required in the final release. </p>

If you check the "Stack Usage Watermark" option, a pattern (0xCC) is written into each stack space. During runtime, this watermark is used to calculate the maximum memory usage. In Arm Keil MDK, this figure is reported in the threads section of the View - Watch Window - RTX RTOS window.</p>

However, if you are writing a safety critical or secure application then "unprivileged mode" can be used to prevent thread access to critical processor registers limiting run time errors or attempts at intrusion.</p>

System Timer Configuration</h2>
<p>The default timer for use with CMSIS-RTOS is the Cortex-M SysTick timer which is present on nearly all Cortex-M processors. The input to the SysTick timer will generally be the CPU clock. It is possible to use a different timer by overloading the kernel timer functions as outlined explained in the <a class="el" href="group__CMSIS__RTOS__TickAPI.html">OS Tick API</a> documentation.</p>

Conclusion</h1>
<p>In this tutorial, we have worked our way through the CMSIS-RTOS2 API and introduced some of the key concepts associated with using an RTOS. The only real way to learn how to develop with an RTOS is to actually use one in a real project. </p>
