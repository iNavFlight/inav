## Contributing guide
This document serves as a checklist before contributing to this repository.
It includes links to read up on if topics are unclear to you.

This guide mainly focuses on the proper use of Git.

### 1. Before opening an issue
In order to centralize your bug reports and requests and to ease their tracking please file an issue into the firmware repository [STM32CubeF7](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeF7/issues/new/choose).

Please check the following boxes before posting an issue:

- [ ] `Make sure you are using the latest commit (major releases are Tagged, but corrections are available as new commits).`
- [ ] `Make sure your issue is a question/feedback/suggestions RELATED TO the software provided in this repo.` Otherwise, it should be discussed on the [ST Community/STM32 MCUs forum](https://community.st.com/s/group/0F90X000000AXsASAW/stm32-mcus).
- [ ] `Make sure your issue is not already reported/fixed on GitHub or discussed on a previous Issue.` Please refer to this [dashboard](https://github.com/orgs/STMicroelectronics/projects/2) for the list of issues and pull-requests. Do not forget to browse into the **closed** issues.


### 2. Posting the issue
Once you have checked the previous boxes, you will find two templates for issues (Bug Report or Other Issue) available in the **Issues** tab of the firmware repository.

### 3. Pull Requests
